# Learning CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful styling language that enhances the visual appearance and layout of HTML documents. By learning CSS, you gain the ability to apply styles, colors, positioning, and animations to elements on a webpage.

## Getting Started

To begin learning CSS, you need a solid understanding of HTML as CSS is used to style HTML elements. Once you have a good grasp of HTML, you can start exploring CSS to add style and design to your web pages.

### Setting Up

To practice CSS, you can use any text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports CSS. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, or Notepad++. These tools provide syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other features to improve your CSS coding experience.

### CSS Syntax

CSS follows a specific syntax consisting of selectors, properties, and values. Selectors target HTML elements to which you want to apply styles. Properties define the visual aspects you want to modify, such as color, font, size, or layout. Values specify the settings for the selected properties.

```css
/* CSS Syntax Example */
selector {
    property: value;
}
